## Remint and Airdrop Decision

The theft of 129 NFTs represents over half the total current supply of The Cardanaires NFTs. As a result, the decision was made to remint the NFTs with a new policy and airdrop the new NFTs to holders. This decision was made to safeguard the integrity of the Cardanaires NFT collection and ensure fairness to all holders.

## Policy IDs
